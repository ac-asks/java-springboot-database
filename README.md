# springBoot-Project

Messing with Spring Boot. Implements an N tier architecture application with a student database (id, name, study). 

Layer 1 is the controller - handles http request REST API.
Layer 2 is the service.
Layer 3 is the data access for retrieving data from db (in this case, MongoDB).
